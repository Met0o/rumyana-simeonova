      Welcome to this space. I am Rumyana, a therapist in training who believes that therapy can be both gentle and practical.
      This blog will document my learning journey, share resources that clients often find helpful, and offer glimpses into how
      I approach collaborative care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the coming months I will be completing supervised practice while preparing to open a small online clinic serving
      clients across Bulgaria and the EU. My work draws on cognitive-behavioural therapy, mindfulness, and compassion-focused
      approaches. I am particularly interested in supporting people who are managing anxiety, burnout, or major life transitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are considering therapy, I invite you to book a free introductory call. We will get to know one another, discuss
      what support could look like, and decide whether we want to continue together. There is no obligation to commit and I am
      happy to suggest other resources if I am not the right fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for reading and for trusting me with a small part of your day. I look forward to sharing more reflections,
      practical exercises, and updates as the practice grows.
    </p>
