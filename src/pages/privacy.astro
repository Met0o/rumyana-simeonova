    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: July 2024</p>

    <p>
      This website introduces the future therapy practice of Rumyana Simeonova. I aim to collect the minimum amount of
      information necessary to provide useful services. No analytics or advertising cookies are in use.
    </p>

    <h2>Who is responsible?</h2>
    <p>
      The website is managed by Rumyana Simeonova, based in Sofia, Bulgaria. You can contact me via the <a href="/contact/">contact
      form</a> for any privacy questions.
    </p>

    <h2>What data is collected?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Website hosting:</strong> Pages are served via GitHub Pages. GitHub may log standard technical information such as
        IP addresses and browser details for security purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Booking:</strong> Introductory calls are scheduled through Calendly. When you book, Calendly collects the details you
        provide (name, email, availability). Please avoid including sensitive health data in the booking notes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Contact form:</strong> Messages are sent via Formspree and delivered to my inbox. The form asks for your email address
        and message so I can respond. Do not share medical information or crisis details.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How is data used?</h2>
    <p>I use your information solely to respond to enquiries and manage bookings. Data is not sold or shared with advertisers.</p>

    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      Emails and booking information are retained only for as long as needed to communicate with you or provide services. You may
      request deletion at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>
      If you reside in the EU or UK, you have rights to access, correct, or delete your personal data. Contact me to exercise
      these rights.
    </p>

    <h2>Updates</h2>
    <p>
      This policy may evolve as services expand. Significant changes will be noted on this page with an updated revision date.
